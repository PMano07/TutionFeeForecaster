# Introduction
In this Project we will analyze the tution fees of all the instituation types for the past few decades. 
Using the past years data will create a model that could predict the college tution fee for future decades. 
This model could help the students to forecast their financial and plan their college. 


# Overview
To perform this ananlysis will use the data from https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_330.10.asp
The data set have data from 1960 onwards, the features include Tution fee, boarding fee , room fee for 2 year and 4 year program.
Data is also classified between Public institution and private institutions.
We will be using the Timeseries framework to build the model, will clean up the data to ensure there is no special characters, 
and use a proper date feature as an index. we will use part of data for training the model and test the model with remaining data.
Will compare the model results for the test period and actual data for that period, tune till we get the model within the permissible error limit.
After we get the model fully trained forecast for the future period.

# Deliverables

Python jupyter notebook having the program to create the model and forecasting results are attached.
Various plots are created for the each stage of model building. A histogram will be presented for the last few decades of tution fees
for both private and public institutions.
